            The final stages of marathon preparation are when a runner needs to
            call on the mental and strength built during months of training.
            There’s a physical test too, of course, with long runs that can go
            beyond 20-miles (32 kilometers) and the heaviness of cumulative
            fatigue. But it’s the whispers about “hitting the wall” (running out
            of energy reserves during the run) that really make first-time
            marathoners apprehensive.

            In the penultimate chapter of our five-part video series 26.2 Miles:
            The Runners’ Story, the two remaining runners, Corbin Shaw and
            Hélène Selam Kleih, discuss this so-called “maranoia” with those
            who’ve already experienced crossing the finish line.
            <br /> <br />
            Talking to fashion designer Charles Jeffrey, Corbin shares his hope
            that a focus on mindset throughout his training will help him
            embrace the marathon experience, even when things inevitably get
            tough. “Through this whole journey of training for a marathon, I’ve
            focused on myself mentally,” Corbin explains. “I want to succumb to
            the event and be completely immersed in it.”
            <br /> <br />
            In her search to find the right headspace on race day, Hélene speaks
            with triathlete and running coach Olivia Ross-Hurst, who doesn’t
            sugarcoat the challenge ahead. “Expect the hard times – the marathon
            is a real journey,” is Olivia’s advice. “It’s a mental game, but the
            training is going to give you confidence, and that’s how we tap into
            mental strength.”
            <br /> <br />
            Find out how Corbin and Hélène’s preparations pay off on marathon
            day in the final episode of the series. Olivia sums it up well:
            “It’s going to be a rollercoaster.”
